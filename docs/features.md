# Features

What stemtrace records about your Celery tasks, and what the dashboard shows.

## Features

**See What Happened**
- **Task Flow Graphs**: Visualize chains, groups, and chords as interactive DAGs ([Graphs](graphs.md))
- **Execution Timeline**: Track queued → started → retried → finished states
- **Full lifecycle tracking**: PENDING → STARTED → SUCCESS/FAILURE, with RECEIVED when `publish_received=True` is set on the worker ([Received events](configuration.md#received-events-opt-in))
- **Arguments & Results**: Inspect inputs, outputs, and exceptions
- **Task Output**: See what each attempt printed and logged, next to the task (opt-in, see [Task output](configuration.md#task-output-print-and-logging))
- **Retry Chains**: Understand exactly when and why retries happened
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket-powered live dashboard

**Canvas Support**
- **Groups & Chords**: Automatic visualization of `group()` and `chord()` patterns
- **Parent-Child Tracking**: See which task spawned which

**Worker Monitoring & Registry**
- **Workers page**: See which workers are online/offline and what tasks they have registered
- **Registry status badges**: Quickly spot tasks that are active, never run, or not registered by any current worker

**Production Ready**
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Uses your existing broker (Redis or RabbitMQ), no database needed
- **Sensitive Data Scrubbing**: Passwords and API keys filtered automatically ([Security](security.md))
- **Read-Only**: Safe for production; never modifies your task queue
- **FastAPI Integration**: Mount into your existing app with one line ([Deployment](deployment.md#embedded-in-fastapi))

## What you'll see in the dashboard

### Task details (timing, inputs/outputs, errors)

- **What you'll see**: Per-task execution timing (including how long it spent in each state), parameters (args/kwargs), return value, and the full event history.
- **Why it helps**: Quickly answer "what happened?" for a single task: slow queueing vs slow execution, which retry succeeded, and (on failures) the exception + traceback for debugging.

### Flow graphs (chains, groups, chords)

- **What you'll see**: An interactive DAG of your workflow with parent→child edges, plus clear GROUP/CHORD containers for Celery canvas patterns.
- **Why it helps**: Understand fan-out/fan-in at a glance (especially chords), spot which branch failed, and debug "why didn't my callback run?" without grepping logs.

### Task registry (registration status + warnings)

- **What you'll see**: A registry of tasks with status badges like **Active**, **Never Run**, and **Not Registered** plus "registered by …" worker info.
- **Why it helps**: Catch misconfigurations where tasks get stuck in **PENDING** because no current worker has the task registered (common in multi-repo or deploy drift scenarios).

### Workers and registry tabs

stemtrace uses **Celery inspect** on demand to populate workers and registered tasks, so those
pages work even if the server missed `worker_ready` events.

- A Celery nodename (`name@host`) has at most one live process, so a worker is shown online
  only for its newest pid: when a node restarts, its older pids go offline, including one that
  was killed without a `worker_shutdown` event. A ping reply carries no pid, so it can only
  bring back the newest pid, never one that sent `worker_shutdown`. When the stream and an
  inspect reply disagree, whichever is newer wins: events that arrive while the server waits
  for a reply beat that reply.
- **Limitation: duplicate nodenames.** Two live workers that share a nodename (e.g. started
  with the same `-n`, which Celery itself warns about with `DuplicateNodenameWarning`) can't be
  told apart: Celery keeps only the last reply per nodename, so they flip between online and
  offline on every refresh. Give each worker a unique nodename.
